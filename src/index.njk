          <p>
            At the age of 16, I’ve finished earlier my high school and university preparations
            A level Program of British System of Education with high grades. This led me to
            learning programming and achieving certificates as well as experience with HTML,
            CSS, JavaScript and learning about how to use some of the JavaScript frameworks such as Node.js,
            React and the latest, Alpine.js. I'm also learning how to create static sites by using eleventy,
            with this project being an example of it.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-8">
            I have completed the <a class="link text-blue-400 cursor-pointer" target="_blank" href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-full-stack-cloud-developer">IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate</a>
            and I'm aspiring to complete more certificates as time goes on.
            I'm very interested in chess and complex puzzles apart from programming and
            I hope in the future I will become a computer games programmer or a software engineer.
